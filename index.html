  <h3 class="flashy">Red Velvet</h3>
  <p>If one flavor is synonymous with Sprinkles Cupcakes, it is Red Velvet! Our most popular cupcake was developed by Sprinkles founder Candace Nelson as an homage to her husband Charles and his deep Oklahoma roots. As a chocolate lover, Candace upped the chocolate quotient with Callebaut cocoa, mellowing the red color to a sophisticated hue. Set against the lily white of rich cream cheese frosting, the contrast is gorgeous... if only we had the self-restraint to sit and admire it!</p>

  <h3 class="flashy">Dark Chocolate</h3>
  <p>You are perpetually on the hunt for the most decadent and complex chocolate gems to dazzle your sophisticated palate. Strike it "rich" with Sprinkles Dark Chocolate cupcakes! Ample cocoa gives this cake its intense flavor while fragrant Madagascar Bourbon vanilla adds a rich perfume. Topped with a creamy, bittersweet frosting and real chocolate sprinkles from France, the only other thing in the world you'll want is an ice cold glass of milk!</p>

  <h3>Vanilla</h3>
  <p>Purists will delight in Sprinkles Vanilla cupcakes, though our vanilla cake is anything but simple. A favorite of the bakery staff, this soft, delicate cake is perfumed by the sweet flavor of pure vanilla for an effect that is simply... heaven.</p>
